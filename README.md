# DSA in Java 🚀

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice implemented in **Java**.  
All solutions are written with a strong focus on **core logic, optimal approaches, and interview readiness**.

The repository is structured topic-wise to enable **systematic learning, easy navigation, and long-term scalability**.
